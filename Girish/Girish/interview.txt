RAID0 = Striping (Half data to 1 disk and half to another)
RAID1 = Mirroring (Writes same data to 2 disks)
RAID5 = Single Disk Distributed Parity ( Writes data in sequence, requires 4 disk, write data on 1 disk at a time, recovery faster)
RAID6 = Double Disk Distributed Parity ( Writes data in sequence, requires 4 disk, write data on 4 disks at a time, recovery slower)
RAID10 = Combine of Mirror & Stripe. (Nested RAID)

Software RAID - present on host itself and loads after OS, No costing
Hardware RAID - RAID controller card, high performance, involves cost


Linux Boot Process:

BIOS (Basic I/O system) - Loads data present in the MBR

MBR - Master Boot Record is located in the 1st sector of the bootable disk. Typically /dev/hda, or /dev/sda

GRUB - GRUB stands for Grand Unified Bootloader, If you have multiple kernel images installed on your system, you can choose which one to be executed.
GRUB displays a splash screen, waits for few seconds, if you don’t enter anything, it loads the default kernel image as specified in the grub configuration file. Grub configuration file is /boot/grub/grub.conf (/etc/grub.conf is a link to this).

GRUB just loads and executes Kernel and initrd images.

Kernel

Mounts the root file system as specified in the “root=” in grub.conf
Kernel executes the /sbin/init program
Since init was the 1st program to be executed by Linux Kernel, it has the process id (PID) of 1

Init - Init identifies the default initlevel from /etc/inittab and uses that to load all appropriate program.

0 – halt
1 – Single user mode
2 – Multiuser, without NFS
3 – Full multiuser mode
4 – unused
5 – X11
6 – reboot

Runlevel programs

Depending on your default init level setting, the system will execute the programs from one of the following directories.

Run level 0 – /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/
Run level 1 – /etc/rc.d/rc1.d/
Run level 2 – /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/
Run level 3 – /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
Run level 4 – /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
Run level 5 – /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/
Run level 6 – /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/


LVM - In Linux, Logical Volume Manager is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel. Most modern Linux distributions are LVM-aware to the point of being able to have their root file systems on a logical volume

DKIM
A DKIM record or DomainKeys Identified Mail record displays the public key for authenticating messages that have been signed with the DKIM protocol. This practice increases the capability to check mail authenticity.

SOA
An SOA record or Start of Authority record labels a zone file with the name of the host where it was originally created. Next, it lists the contact email address for the person responsible for the domain

Serial number, Refresh time, Retry time, Expire time, Minimum TTL

SPF
An SPF record or Sender Policy Framework record lists the designated mail servers for a domain, It helps establish the legitimacy of your mail server and reduces the chances of spoofing
