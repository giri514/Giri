Subject: Jetbackup Failure Notification




--------
It is good to see you are making good use of your server “odedi56318.mywhc.ca”. However, as a part of server monitoring system, we noticed that backup for the server 'odedi56318' is failing at the moment.

Reason for backup failure

Your external backup drive does not have enough available free disk space to successfully complete the backup process.

Current disk space usage:

Filesystem                                                 Size    Used   Avail Capacity  Mounted on
backup/odedi56318                                          2.0T    1.9T    100G    95%    /mnt/backup/odedi56318

We always recommend reserving around 10% of your entire disk space for the server backup process.

How to resolve this issue?

Please take one of the following steps to rectify the issue:
Purchase the additional external backup disk space.
Reduce the backup retention set on your server and cleanup the old backups in order to free up the disk space.
NOTE : Please be aware that until this is resolved, you do not have functional backups. As such, your prompt attention in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

If you would like more information about increasing your external backup disk space, please let us know, so we will get back to you with the more information.

Thank you.
