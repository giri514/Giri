Thank you for contacting Web Hosting Canada.

Please note that this type of hoax is part of the Bitcoin scam and a type of email blackmail. In addition, I blocked the IP address [176.209.5.231] in the server firewall to avoid this problem.

How did they get your password?

Many websites offer you the possibility to create an account. For example, shopping websites, forums, communities, blogs, etc.

It is quite common for websites with identifiers to be compromised and for fraudsters to obtain your email address and the password you use to log in. It is also very common for people to choose the same password for sites like this one (because it is easier to remember). However, if the email account is managed by Easykey, we will have created a random password that is difficult to guess.

How do I know if it's a hoax?

The most obvious flaw in this plan is that BitCoin is an anonymous payment service. A large number of fraudulent e-mails use exactly the same BitCoin address. Therefore, even if the ransom were paid, the extortioner would not be able to say who paid it; so, logically, how are they supposed to know who is not attacking? In addition, people stupid enough to have paid a ransom continued to receive identical threat emails.

Nevertheless, many people have been caught up in this scam because they use details that seem familiar to you.

Actions required on your side:
Delete the email or mark it as phishing
Change your email account password (in case they guessed it)
Do not reply to such an email.

Please check and let me know if you need further assistance.
