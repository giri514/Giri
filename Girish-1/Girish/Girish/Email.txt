You can send 200 emails per hour but it should not defer more than 25 emails per hours, in that case, your domain "groupehaus.com" has exceeded the max defers and failures per hour due to which your emails are being discarded.

Also, this error is derived from an hourly monitoring system, where any blocked domains are allowed to send email again at the top of every hour.

In order to avoid such incidence check your mailing lists/Contact list is up to date. If you are sending a mass marketing email, please check your mailing list is up to date by removing email addresses which no longer work.

Or

Hello Shauna,

I could see that your email address "shauna@designfarm.ink" was locked in our spamfilter system because of the high amount of messages from this address in a short period of time, having "test1" or "test4" as a subject, most of which don't resemble with legitimate emails.

For now, we have unlocked the email address "shauna@designfarm.ink" and you will be able to send emails. 

I have tried to send an email from shauna@designfarm.ink to our test Gmail account "whctest6@gmail.com " and it's working fine.

Please check the following screenshot for your reference.

Hello Jonathan,

Thank you for contacting Web Hosting Canada. 

I could see that your email address "eunice@hakvoort.ca" was locked in our outbound spam filter system because of sending more than 1 urlbl in less than six hours. 

For now, I have unlocked the user "eunice@hakvoort.ca" and you will be able to send emails.

I remain at your disposal if you have any other questions.

Server Error: UID SORT: Internal error occurred. Refer to server log for more information. [2019-06-29 14:50:36] (0.011 + 0.000 + 0.010 secs).

This, in turn, causes the error due to the expected size that it had from cache.

A list of the affected files can be generated with the following command: 

 find /home/horites/mail/horites.com/formation -type f -size 0 -ls

find /home/webfeed/mail/webfeed.ca/steve/cur/ -type f -size 0 -exec mv -v {} /root/cptech/12695111/steve/ \;
find /home/webfeed/mail/webfeed.ca/trudi/cur/ -type f -size 0 -exec mv -v {} /root/cptech/12695111/trudi/ \;



The issue that you are currently experiencing with these email addresses is due to a few message files being 0 bytes is sizes.

Those email folders were not being subscribed to in which I manually subscribed to the "Copap World" and "Copap World.Clientes" folders for leticia@copap.com by running the following commands:

# sudo -u copapcom doveadm mailbox subscribe -u leticia@copap.com 'INBOX.Copap World'
# sudo -u copapcom doveadm mailbox subscribe -u leticia@copap.com 'INBOX.Copap World.Clientes'

Spam expert IP blacklist: 

Please note Backscatterer.org lists servers that use so called "sender verification" callouts. This is generally accepted behavior, and fully support by the SMTP RFC 5321. Because backscatterer.org does not follow the official specifications, it has listed most (legitimate) mailservers in the world. Therefore it is never used by any party for email blocking, and you can safely ignore the listing.

Also checking now shows the IP is not listed anymore.
-------------------
Please note that all of your outbound emails gets routed through our outbound mail filtering system and which is based on several different algorithms to block outbound emails of individual email account.
