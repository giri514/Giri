Following are the answers of your queries:

1) Could you let us know exactly what type of work the 3 hours of SysAdmin work would involve? What would happen if there was a problem requiring more than 3 hours of this work?
=> Please note that 3 hours of SysAdmin work involves different kind of tasks such as installation/configuration of any kind of custom modules on the server, migration of accounts from the different hosting provider if any, unexpected service down failure/recovery on the server, etc. If you exceed these 3 hrs of Sysadmin work in any case, then there will be additional charge depending upon task handled by our technicians.

2) What kind of support does Advanced Management offer in terms of security, specifically if there is a security breach that occurs with the server as opposed to at the website level?
=> We usually install the required modules on the server, which are at stable version and patched to well known vulnerability. Further, we also configure the firewall on your server and do the firewall hardening in order to secure your server. If there is any security breach in any case, then we do take the necessary actions depending on the situation.

3) What does Advanced Firewall configuration involve?

====================

Firstly, I do apologize for the inconvenience caused to you and I can understand your frustration in this matter. However, we haven't receive any server down alert related to your host on our monitoring system as server IP address was pinging properly from outside network, which has resulted in the delay of troubleshooting your issue further.

I have also checked the logs on your server and it appears that there was no load on it before server become inaccessible. Following are the logs for your reference.


In such situation, I would recommend you to purchase the advance management for your dedicated server, which includes monitoring of all the services present on your server and will be resulting in quick action from our end in case anything went down on your server.

Let me know if you would like to buy this service, so I will send you an invoice accordingly.
