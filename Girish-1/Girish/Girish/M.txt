Re: Magento detects a wrong php version in multiPHP envirornment of WHM / cpanel
I have figured out that it's not Magento and not the Data Migration Tool that is checking php version but the Composer! The solution is forcing Composer to ignore requirements with --ignore-platform-reqsoption. Like so:

composer config repositories.magento composer https://repo.magento.com
composer require magento/data-migration-tool:<version> --ignore-platform-reqs
