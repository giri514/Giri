Hello Lisa,

Thanks for contacting Web Hosting Canada.

Please note that the email notification, you have got is regarding the md5sum comparison test this usually takes place after the cPanel update in which all old parameters are compared with a new one so you can safely ignore this alert.

I remain at your disposal should you have any additional questions.
